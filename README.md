# AniList Generated Changelog

Someone on the discord asked for a changelog for the AniList GraphQL API, so I set this up as a fun little project.

It checks and diffs the API schema every 30 minutes, and updates the changelog in the repo if there are any changes.

## [The changelog is found here](./CHANGELOG.md)

If you want to receive **notifications** about new changes, you can enable them specifically for `Releases`:
